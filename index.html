      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="text">
        <span>Lighting and Look Development Artists </span>are responsible for taking direction from the director and concept artwork from the art
        director and then crafting the final visual aesthetics and image output for the film. The job is a balance between traditional artistry and
        engineering. An artist must not only create the visual image, but they must also construct dynamic technical rigs that manipulate data to
        achieve the results in animation. Being responsible for all the final images that appear in the film gives the lighting artist the ability to
        help set the visual mood and emotional tone of a movie. Understanding the story the director is trying to tell the audience is crucial for
        conveying the right meaning through the images created. The artist must empathetically imagine how the audience will interpret every creative
        decision they make. <span>Technical Director</span> â€“ Data management is crucial for feature film computer animation. There is a rigid
        pipeline put together by engineers to enable this process. A technical director is the bridge between the artists and the engineers who handle
        technical difficulties. These problems arise within the pipeline that has been built to achieve the desired artistic look in a fast-paced
        environment with very tight deadlines.
